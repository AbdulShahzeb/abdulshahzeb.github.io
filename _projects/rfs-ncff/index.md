# Overview
This project showcases a complete network-centric intelligent system that was developed as part of a collaboration between the NSW Rural Fire Service and the Australian Centre for Robotics at the University of Sydney. All five systems - ground robot, tethered drone, wearables, vehicle telemetry, and helicopter payload - work together to form a network-centric firefighting architecture.

## Wearables
Monitor biometric and environmental data - such as heart rate, motion, temperature, and air quality and generate automated alerts when thresholds are exceeded.

## Vehicle Telemetry System
Captures key operational parameters from RFS fire appliances, including water tank levels, fuel status, GPS, and roll/tilt data.

## Helicopter-Based Communication Repeater
Airborne LoRa repeater developed to extend communication coverage for firefighter wearables and sensor systems in remote or obstructed terrain.

## Common Operating Picture
Data from each platform is fused in a shared Common Operating Picture, offering a real-time, centralised view of personnel, vehicles, terrain, and alerts.
